### OpenMic is a REST API built with Django Rest Framework, for use with [OpenMic](Https://open-mic.netlify.app/) front-end app using React.

The [OpenMic API](https://team-open-mic.herokuapp.com/api/) provides the backend & API of our OpenMic app. OpenMic allows users to create an artist or band profiles, connect with other musicians or bands via direct messages, follow bands or artists that you like and able to search for musicians/bands based on music genre or instruments needed or wanted. 

This was the final project for [Momentum Learning](https://www.momentumlearn.com/), created by [David Calix](https://github.com/calixd7).
